## Exercise I

a) The run time of this alorithim is O(n) because as n increase the run time increase linearly. For example if n = 2 then it will take 2 loop for a to be greater than n^3 where if n = 10 it will take 10 loops.
b)  The run time of this algorithi is  O(n^2) because the inner for loop (while) is linear time that is nested inside of the outter for loop making this O(n(n)) that simplify to O(n^2).
c) The run time of this algorithim is O(2^N) The ammount of operation needed grows exponentially for each level of recursion.

## Exercise II

My solution for this problem woould be implementing a binary search method.
We first find the middle floor of n. Drop the egg and check if the egg breaks if it dont break to the middle of the upper portion and dropp the egg. I repeat this until the there is a single midpoint whre the egg break and the floor below is the limit of which f lies.
This solution is O of log(n) time.
